            <div face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Chocolate, derived from the seed
                    of the cocoa tree, was used by the Maya Culture, as early as the Sixth Century AD.
                    Maya called the cocoa tree <i>cacahuaquchtl… </i>"tree," and the word chocolate
                    comes from the Maya word <i>xocoatl</i> which means bitter water.

                    To the Mayas, cocoa pods symbolized life and fertility... nothing could be more
                    important! Stones from their palaces and temples revealed many carved pictures of
                    cocoa pods.

            <div face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Moving from Central America to the northern
                portions of South America, the Mayan territory stretched from the Yucatán Peninsula
                to the Pacific Coast of Guatemala. In the Yucatán, the Mayas cultivated the earliest
                know cocoa plantations. The cocoa pod was often represented in religious rituals,
                and the texts their literature refer to cocoa as the god’s food
